## About Me
As a Software Development graduate from Manitoba Institute of Trades and Technology, I have learned the tools to shape the internet myself. From sleek front-end design to robust data structures and innovative software, I've gained a wealth of knowledge. While I'm new to the field, I've been busy putting that knowledge to use.

I've built a strong foundation and a growing portfolio that reflects my dedication and progress. In addition to my skills with coding and design, I bring creativity, a strong work ethic, and a knack for unique problem-solving to every project I take on. I am currently open and seeking work, however I'm also interested in inspiration or collaboration.
