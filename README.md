## About Me
Hello world, it's Dave. I'm a recent Fullstack Software Development graduate from Manitoba Institute of Trades and Technology in Winnipeg.  
I have spent the past year with my imagination and my fingers going wild creating new things and turning script into reality. The creative and professional potential is astonishing. 

I'm proud to highlight most of my work on my personal site [DS Code](https://ds-code.ca) and my largest project (for now) is [Blackjack](https://dave-sommerville.github.io/blackjack/)

I also welcome collaboration; so if you see anything in my future plans below or if you have a project of your own you'd like my spin on, 
please reach out to me [here](mailto:dave.r.sommerville@outlook.com). 

### My Languages
Proficient: HTML/CSS, JavaScript, C#, SQL

Familiar: Git, Node.js, React, PHP

### Horizon Projects
I always have projects on the go (such as a comprehensive dungeon crawler console app), but I also always have more ideas on the horizon. So I'm calling them Horizon Projects. I'm always excited about the possibility of collaboration, so if you're interested in working on any of these with me, please reach out! 

####Basic Projects
- Minesweeper clone
- Basic paint editor
- Grocery/Menu tracking API

####Larger Explorations
- Basic AI Exploration (Battleship / Cheat)
- Experimenting with unexplored DOM elements (camera, geolocation, touchscreen, etc)
- 3Script 1Project (creating a single yet to be determined program idea in three different programming languages)
- A stylish and modern financial services website example with full MVC and Entity Framework architecture
- A small, multi level side scroller game, implementing AI mechanics in code (using Unity or Godot)
